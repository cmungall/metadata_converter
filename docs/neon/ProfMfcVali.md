## Attributes


### Inherited from profMfcVali_L0prime:

 * [frtSet0](frtSet0.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: Flow rate (frt) set point (Set) at National Institute of Standards and Technology standard conditions (0, which are 293.15 K, 101.325 kPa), synonymous with mass flow rate set point
    * range: [Double](types/Double.md)
 * [qfFrt0](qfFrt0.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: Flag indicates whether the gas flow rate is within the acceptable tolerance (1=fail, 0=pass, -1=NA (i.e, could not be run))
    * range: [Integer](types/Integer.md)
    * inherited from: None

### Inherited from profMfm_L0prime:

 * [presAtm](presAtm.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: Pressure (pres), measured as atmospheric (Atm) pressure, synonymous with absolute pressure or total pressure (at sea level the standard atmospheric pressure is 101.325 kPa)
    * range: [Double](types/Double.md)
 * [temp](temp.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: Temperature (temp)
    * range: [Double](types/Double.md)
 * [frt](frt.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: Flow rate (frt) at site temperature and pressure, synonymous with volumetric flow rate
    * range: [Double](types/Double.md)
 * [frt0](frt0.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: Flow rate (frt) at National Institute of Standards and Technology standard conditions (0, which are  293.15 K, 101.325 kPa), synonymous with mass flow rate
    * range: [Double](types/Double.md)
