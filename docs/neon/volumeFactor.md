# Type: volumeFactor


A factor analogous to plot size that influences the length of the transects along which coarse downed wood particles are tallied; for a given coarse downed wood particle diameter, smaller F-values mean longer distances are searched for that diameter, and larger F-values mean shorter distances are searched for that diameter
